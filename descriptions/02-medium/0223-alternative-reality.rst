ALTERNATIVE REALITY
===================

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:
----------------------

Have you even wondered about another life? Maybe there is an alternative
reality where different things are happening. Everything is almost the same,
but still a bit different…

You are walking in one reality, but driving the car in another. Here you like
golf, and there – basketball. In one reality you changed a $100 banknote to
five $20 banknotes, while in another – to ten $10 banknotes.

Today, your task is to count how many alternative versions of money change are
if you have 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, and 50¢ coins.

So, if you have 11 cents that you need to change, you have four alternative
ways how to do it:
::
   1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1
   5+1+1+1+1+1+1
   5+5+1
   10+1

number of cents that you want to change.
