CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:
----------------------

You are given an n*n matrix of integers. You can move only right and
down. Calculate the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right

INPUT SAMPLE:
-------------

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. The
first line will have the value of n(the size of the square matrix). This will
be followed by n rows of the matrix. (Integers in these rows will be comma
delimited). After the n rows, the pattern repeats. E.g.
::
   2
   4,6
   2,8
   3
   1,2,3
   4,5,6
   7,8,9

OUTPUT SAMPLE:
--------------

Print out the minimum path sum for each matrix. E.g.
::
   14
   21
