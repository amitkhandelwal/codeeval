POKER HANDS
===========

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:
----------------------

In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from
lowest to highest, in the following way:
::
   High Card: Highest value card.
   One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
   Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
   Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
   Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
   Flush: All cards of the same suit.
   Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
   Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
   Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
   Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
   The cards are valued in the order:
   2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest
value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives. But if two
ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards
in each hand are compared; if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards
are compared, and so on.
